Hello, This is Aryan. This is my third basic project to practice and revise my newly learntCSS concepts.
In this project, I have used some CSS concepts such as Grid, Flexbox.
Anybody who is currently learning, HTML, CSS and want to practice the concepts, then projects are the best way to do the same.

If you want to practice too, then follow the below steps:-
1. First Look at goal.png and dimensions.png
2. According to that type your CSS and HTML code.
3. Use Grids and Flexbox to achieve the goal.
If you were successful in achieving the goal, then congrats otherwise look at my code and solve your doubts and practice again.

NOTE:If you find a better way to do the same goal, push youcan push your file to this repository, but please don't modify original codes and content.
