Hello, This is Aryan. This is my second basic project to practice and revise my newly learntCSS concepts.
In this project, I have used some CSS concepts such as Grid, Flexbox.
Anybody who is currently learning, HTML, CSS and want to practice the concepts, then projects are the best way to do the same.

If you want to practice too, then follow the below steps:-
1. First Look at goal.png and dimensions.png
2. According to that type your CSS and HTML code.
3. Use Grids and Flexbox to achieve the goal.
If you were successful in achieving the goal, then congrats otherwise look at my code and solve your doubts and practice again.

NOTE: Do not use Flexbox or Grid concepts, as these were intentionally not done using them.
And if you find a better way to do the same goal, push it to the repo, but please don't modify original codes and content.
